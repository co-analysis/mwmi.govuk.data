They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category. Avon & Somerset and Derbyshire probation trusts were unable to submit data for May 2011 due to local staffing/technical issues; the most recent figures they submitted at that point in time have therefore been included within the overall staffing figures. A number of probation areas merged on 1st April 2010 to become trusts; the old probation areas (Dyfed Powys, Gwent, North Wales and South Wales) that now comprise the 'Wales Probation Trust' have continued to submit data separately as they have yet to merge their HR systems. Gwent were unable to submit data for May 2011 due to local technical issues and therefore the most recent figures they submitted at that point in time have been included within the overall staffing figures.","At present, we are unable to fulfil the paybill requirement. Probation trusts operate under a formal contract with NOMS and are only required to submit management accounts returns on an annual basis. We would therefore be able to provide an annual picture but there will be a time lag due to the process of consolidating and validating the accounts.
We are currently conducting a joint review with probation trusts and the Probation Association with a view to streamlining our workforce data collections and ensuring that we only collect data where there is a clear business requirement either for management, accountability or statutory reporting. We will expand this review to include the requirement set out by the Cabinet Office including the resource implications of providing this data. The review is scheduled to complete over the summer so we will be in a position to report back to the Cabinet Office post recess.
