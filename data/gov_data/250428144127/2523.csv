Workforce data will be reviewed in light of adding SFA onto payroll, additional NDPB responsibilities and reviewing contingent labour data following IR35 work.Please note we are unable to split the contingent labour by interims or specialist contractors. Consultants/Consultancy cannot be measured in HC or FTE.  In previous monthly workforce MI returns, only Hays agency staff were recorded.  From April 2012 onwards, agency staff from both Reed and Hays will be recorded and from May 2014 Brook Street information will be recorded.  "
