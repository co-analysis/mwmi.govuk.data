We were also given more recent permissions (February 2013) to recruit up to 11 FTE additional posts  - but within the envelope of existing budgets - primarily to help cover a new work stream (Council Tax Reduction appeals). This work area became active within the VTS's remit from 1st April 2013. The majority of these staff started during June and July 2013 as was indicated would be the case in our recent monthly submissions. Any residual appointments will be shown in the forthcoming months as they come in to the organisation. The agency worker identified in the figures applied for - and was successful - in obtaining a permanent position and has moved over to the establishment part-way through the month.
