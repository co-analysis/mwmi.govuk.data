The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.
A new system for collecting workforce information from the probation trusts was implemented in July 2012. The previous collection system (HR Data Warehouse) was decommissioned at the end of June 2012 and replaced by a series of HR returns to the NOMS Performance Hub. The new collection system enables improved reporting, due to clarification on the funding arrangements of staff seconded out of trusts. NOMS has therefore been able to provide accurate figures on the number of staff that are funded by the probation trusts from July 2012 onwards. These figures will therefore not correlate with figures provided prior to July 2012, as those figures would have included all funded and unfunded staff."
