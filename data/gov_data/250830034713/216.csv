The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category. Avon and Somerset, Greater Manchester and Norfolk and Suffolk probation trusts were unable to submit data for December 2011 due to local technical/staffing issues; the most recent figures they submitted at that point in time (November 2011) have therefore been included within the overall staffing figures.","Probation trusts operate under a formal contract with NOMS and are only required to submit management accounts returns on an annual basis. We have recently been conducting a joint review with probation trusts, with a view to streamlining our workforce data collections and ensuring that we only collect data where there is a clear business requirement either for management, accountability or statutory reporting. We expanded this review to consider the feasibility of gathering the full costing data requirement set out by the Cabinet Office but the review has shown that the information is not readily available and would require significant additional resource to collect, collate and quality assure the information from 35 independent bodies each month. Initial estimates suggest this collection would have a minimum cost per annual of £125,000 plus initial development and start up costs; we therefore do not intend to pursue the collection of this data."
