The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.  The Probation Service staffing figures provided relate to a snapshot of the number of staff employed and funded by the probation trusts at the end of the last day of the reporting period. 

Please note, not all of the trusts were able to submit data for this month due to local resourcing issues and 
therefore the most recent data they had submitted has 
been used. The trusts that fall in this category are 
Cheshire and Warwickshire (July 2013 figures included 
for both).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "
