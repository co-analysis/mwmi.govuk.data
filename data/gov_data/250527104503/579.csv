Increased flood budgets for 20-21 compared to last year.
Many of the projects in 20-21 are high level projects from Water Story, Natural Capital, Net Zero Carbon Programme.
There have also been some sizeable costs to do with both COVID19 & Incident response and recovery over the last year.
Many of these projects have required specialised knowledge for which we have had to bring in consultants.
The usual year end accruals process and capturing unbilled costs always inflates the March numbers."
