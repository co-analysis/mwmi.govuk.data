Probation trust staffing figures were extracted from the HR Data Warehouse, where all 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category. Please note, not all of the trusts were able to submit data for this month due to staffing/technical issues and therefore the most recent data they had submitted has been used. The trusts that fall into this category are: Avon & Somerset and Derbyshire (March 2012 figures included for both).    "
