HMCTS are currently working towards bringing workforce reporting forward a month so that HMCTS can report FTE figures alongside financial figures.","Agency FTE has been provided although Headcount data is not available as it is not currently collected.
The staff costs are due to be invoiced by the parent department (DCLG) and once an understanding of the monthly cost is provided an accrual will be raised in future months where an invoice is outstanding. Seeking clarification from DCLG whether their July return has removed RPTS.  
The process for collection data on contingent workers is currently being reviewed by HMCTS and a plan is in place which will see the workforce planning tool populated with Phoenix data on the sixth working day following the data month with a return from the regions required by the 9th working day. This means that by working day 9 (September 11) we hope to have August FTEs and a confirmed August non payroll FTE, therefore we’ll be able to report agency staff figures for future months as required by the Cabinet Office."

They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category. Derbyshire probation trust was unable to submit data for July 2011 due to local technical issues; the most recent figures they submitted at that point in time have therefore been included within the overall staffing figures. A number of probation areas merged on 1st April 2010 to become trusts; the old probation areas (Dyfed Powys, Gwent, North Wales and South Wales) that now comprise the 'Wales Probation Trust' have continued to submit data separately as they have yet to merge their HR systems. Dyfed Powys and South Wales were unable to submit data for July 2011 due to local staffing issues and therefore the most recent figures they submitted at that point in time have been included within the overall staffing figures.","The figures have been updated and are validated figures (20.09.11)
At present, we are unable to fulfil the paybill requirement. Probation trusts operate under a formal contract with NOMS and are only required to submit management accounts returns on an annual basis. We would therefore be able to provide an annual picture but there will be a time lag due to the process of consolidating and validating the accounts.
We are currently conducting a joint review with probation trusts and the Probation Association with a view to streamlining our workforce data collections and ensuring that we only collect data where there is a clear business requirement either for management, accountability or statutory reporting. We will expand this review to include the requirement set out by the Cabinet Office including the resource implications of providing this data. 
The review is scheduled to 
complete over the summer so we 
will be in a position to report 
back to the Cabinet Office 
post recess."
