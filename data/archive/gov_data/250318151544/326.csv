We have therefore recorded all our Agency and Contractor Non-Paid staff under Agency.
The Home Office costs have increased compared to March 2012 as Border Force costs are now met from the core Home Office rather than the UK Border Agency, following a Machinery of Government change.  The Border Force pay remit has been increased by £8m to reflect the IFRS holiday pay accrual that has not been processed in P1 to counter the reversal of the P12 accrual.

The UK Border Agency costs have decreased compared to March 2012 as Border Force costs are now met from the core Home Office rather than the UK Border Agency, following a Machinery of Government change.  £2.2M has been added to the PDR bonus line to reflect the accrual that should have gone in – it is probable that some of this will relate to Border Force but UKBA have not been able to aggregate it as yet.  A further £1.5m has been added to overtime in UKBA – again for a missing accrual.
